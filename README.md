# To-do list requirements

## User stories

### As a busy person, I want to:

- [x] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

- [x] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

- [x] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

### As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

- [ ] Use all the features of the app without a mouse


## Stretch user stories

### As a busy person, I want to:

- [ ] Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do


## EXTRA ISSUES / FEATURES

* Limit length of task word count

* 

## Acceptance Criteria

* A working to-do list
  
* Tests for (at least) each user story

* A responsive, mobile-first design

* Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
